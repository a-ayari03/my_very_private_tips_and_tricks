    "3. Evaluate if each document contains keywords or semantic meaning related to AT LEAST ONE of the user questions.\n",

    "7. Take into account the overall context of each document, not just word-for-word matches.\n",
    "8. If a document provides partial or indirect information related to a question, consider it relevant. Evaluate if the partial information is substantial enough to be useful to the user.\n",
    "9. Pay attention to temporal aspects - a document might be relevant even if it doesn't exactly match the time frame of the question. Consider if dated information could still be relevant or provide useful historical context.\n",
    "10. Consider cultural and contextual nuances that might affect the relevance of the documents to the questions.\n",
    "11. If multiple questions are asked, a document is considered relevant if it substantially answers at least one of the questions.\n",
    "12. If a document directly contradicts the premise of a question but provides correct and relevant information, consider it relevant.\n",
    "13. While assessing reliability is not the primary focus, note any information that is clearly false or misleading.\n",
    "14. For long documents, focus on the sections most relevant to the question.\n",
